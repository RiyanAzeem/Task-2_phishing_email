# Task-2 phishing email analysis
**Introduction**

Phishing emails are fraudulent messages that use social engineering tactics to trick you into providing personal information, downloading infected attachments, or clicking malicious links.

**Common indicators:**

-  Sender address looks slightly wrong (e.g., support@paypall.com).

- Links’ visible text doesn’t match the real URL when you hover.

- Urgent/threatening language (“verify now or account suspended”).

- Poor grammar or unusual formatting.

- Unexpected attachments (ZIP, .exe, Office docs with macros).

**What to do if you suspect one:**

- Do not click links or open attachments.

- Hover links to inspect the destination, check the sender domain.

- Verify via the official site or contact the company using a known phone number/email.

- Check headers or use a header analyzer for deeper verification.

- Report to your IT team or the service provider (and to PhishTank/OpenPhish if appropriate).
